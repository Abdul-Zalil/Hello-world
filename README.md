# Hello-world
Just a basic repository. 


I am new to github. 
I want to learn some skills from here. 
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
